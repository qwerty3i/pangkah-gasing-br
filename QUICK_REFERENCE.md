# 🎮 PANGKAH - Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
**Be the last Gasing spinning!**

---

## 🎮 CONTROLS

### Movement
```
W - Up
A - Left  
S - Down
D - Right
```

### Spin (CRITICAL!)
```
J / K - Alternate to increase RPM
```
⚠️ **MUST ALTERNATE!** J→K→J→K (NOT J→J→J)

---

## 📊 RPM ZONES

| Zone | RPM | Color | Status |
|------|-----|-------|--------|
| 🔘 **Grey** | 0-30 | Grey | DANGER! Sluggish, vulnerable |
| 🟢 **Green** | 30-85 | Green | OPTIMAL! Best control |
| 🔴 **Red** | 85-100 | Red | RISKY! 150% damage, erratic |

---

## ⚡ KEY MECHANICS

### RPM Decay
- **Inside Safe Zone**: -0.5/frame
- **Outside Safe Zone**: -1.5/frame (3x faster!)

### Safe Zone Penalties (Outside)
- ❌ 3x RPM decay
- ❌ 50% input efficiency  
- ❌ 50% movement speed

### Combat
- Higher RPM wins collision
- Red Zone (85+): 150% knockback + 50% self-recoil
- Eliminate: Push out or reduce RPM to 0

---

## 🤖 AI BOTS

**10 colored bots with AI:**
- **Survival Mode**: Move to center when threatened
- **Chase Mode**: Hunt weak targets (low RPM)
- Watch their RPM numbers - attack when low!

---

## 🏆 WIN/LOSE

### Victory ✅
- Last Gasing standing
- All 10 bots eliminated

### Defeat ❌
- RPM reaches 0
- Pushed outside arena

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Stay 40-70 RPM** (sweet spot)
2. **Never drop below 30** (grey zone = death)
3. **Watch the green circle** (safe zone)
4. **Attack low-RPM bots** (check numbers above them)
5. **Red zone for finishing blows** (85+ RPM)
6. **Move to center** as zone shrinks

---

## 🎨 VISUAL GUIDE

```
🟢 Green Dashed Circle = Safe Zone (STAY INSIDE!)
⚪ Grey Circle = Arena Boundary (DON'T CROSS!)
🟤 Brown Area = Rough Terrain (PENALTIES!)
✨ Glowing = Optimal RPM
YOU = Your Gasing (larger)
Numbers = Bot RPM (target low ones!)
```

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

❌ Pressing J→J→J (doesn't work!)
❌ Ignoring safe zone shrink
❌ Fighting in grey zone (low RPM)
❌ Staying outside safe zone
❌ Forgetting to spin (J/K)

✅ Alternate J/K constantly
✅ Stay in green circle
✅ Maintain 40-70 RPM
✅ Move toward center
✅ Attack strategically

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

1. **Spin immediately**: J→K→J→K→J→K
2. **Get to 40+ RPM** (green zone)
3. **Stay in green circle** (safe zone)
4. **Hunt weak bots** (low RPM numbers)
5. **Move to center** as zone shrinks
6. **Win!** 🏆

**Good luck! May your Gasing never stop spinning! 🌀**
